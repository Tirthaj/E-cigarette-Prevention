# E-cigarette-Prevention
Hello!
This project is our Final Project for course CS 695.
This project is created by;
# Tirthaj Rikame G01321938
# Prajwal Desai G01321938

This project consists of Two parts;
# 1. Object Detection Part
# 2. Augmented Reality Part

The project works as follows;
(If you run this project, you can fully experience the AR experience using the mobile device(Android or IOS) as our Project uses GPS geo-location.)

# Step 1:
Open the link for our project that is hosted onto github
The Link: https://tirthaj.github.io/E-cigarette-Prevention/ 

# Step 2:
Give access to all permissions that the web application asks for, i.e. camera access, location access and AR permission access
After doing that, the camera feed should pop up on your screen and this means that our Object Detection model has started working.
It keeps scanning for E-cigarettes, and we have kept a 5 second buffer for detection to help organize the process.
